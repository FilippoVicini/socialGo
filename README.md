# SocialGo

This is a simple project in go to understand how to setup a backend keeping good software principles as a priority.

### Folder structure 
- **Bin**: keeps the compiled go code
- **cmd**: where we keep exectuables and entry points for the application
    - api: anything related to http/server related
    - migrate: migrations folder
        - migrations
- **internal**: all internal packages not to be exported. isolated packages without caring about outside world
- **docs**: where autogenerated docs are kept from swagger
- **scripts**: files to setup our server


## Architecture 
### Theory layers
- **Separation of concerns**: every level in your program should be separate by a clear barrier, the transport layer, the service layer....
- **Dependency inversion principle**: You're injecting the dependencies into layers. Promoting low coupling
- **Ability to change**: if we organize our code in modular and flexible way it is easier to understand, change in the future

### App layers
The idea is to separate layers in order to have a clean architecture
- Transport layer 
    - the way we deliver the message to the users
- Service layer 
    - Where business logic lives
- Storage layer
    - abstracts communication between layers above and DB


### App structure 
We have a user that makes Http requests to an endpoint. 
The endpoint will then be connected to several HTTP Handlers 
In the handlers we will inject layers which will be dependencies 
We will inject the service layer, inside the service layer we will inject the repository layer. 

Injected dependencies depend on abstractions not implementations 
In Go we will have dependencies on interfaces and not structs. Structs can implement interfaces and then we can inject them.
